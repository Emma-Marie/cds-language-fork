Ukrainian officials say that the decision earlier this week to limit civilian and journalistsâ€™ access to the eastern city of Bakhmut was necessary both for the safety of those groups, and to protect operational security.

Ukrainian officials this week said non-local civilians would not be allowed to enter the city, and that stricter protocols had been put in place for journalists to travel there.
